<p>Video platforms rely on high-quality captions to make content accessible, engaging, and compliant with industry standards. SubRip Text (SRT) is a popular subtitle format, but many modern browsers, streaming services, and accessibility tools prefer Web Video Text Tracks (VTT). Converting from SRT to VTT ensures seamless integration with HTML5 players, better cue styling, and improved support for interactive features. Whether you manage a large video library, run a subscription service, or host live streams, adopting VTT elevates user experience and broadens your audience reach.</p>

<p>HappyScribe offers a powerful solution to automate and streamline your SRT to VTT conversion process. By leveraging its reliable API, intuitive subtitle editor, and advanced AI notetaker, you can save time, reduce manual errors, and maintain consistent branding across all your videos. In the sections below, we walk you through a detailed workflow, highlight three key HappyScribe features, answer common questions, and guide you to get started in minutes.</p>

<h3>Step-by-step workflow</h3>
<p>This workflow outlines how to convert SRT files to VTT using local tools, custom scripts, and HappyScribe API calls. You can adapt these steps to a one-off conversion or embed them into a fully automated pipeline for daily processing.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Gather your source files</strong>
    <p>Create a folder on your development machine for all SRT files that require conversion. For example, you might have a directory named <code>subtitles_to_convert</code>. Ensure each file uses a <code>.srt</code> extension and follows the standard SRT timestamp formatting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Obtain your API key</strong>
    <p>Sign in to your HappyScribe account and navigate to your API settings. Copy the API key and store it securely in an environment variable. For example, on Mac or Linux:</p>
    <pre>export HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"</pre>
    <p>On Windows PowerShell:</p>
    <pre>$env:HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Install required tools</strong>
    <p>Use a scripting language like Node.js or Python, and install <code>curl</code> for command line requests. For Python, you may also install the <code>requests</code> library:</p>
    <pre>pip install requests</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload SRT file via API</strong>
    <p>Use a <code>POST</code> request to send your SRT file to HappyScribe. Here is an example with <code>curl</code>:</p>
    <pre>curl -X POST "https://api.happyscribe.com/v2/transcriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/video.mp4" \
  -F "language=en" \
  -F "format=srt"</pre>
    <p>Although this call normally accepts audio or video files, you can specify the existing SRT as the transcript source by passing:</p>
    <pre>curl -X POST "https://api.happyscribe.com/v2/transcriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY" \
  -F "transcript_file=@/path/to/your_subtitle.srt"</pre>
    <p>The response returns a JSON payload with a <code>transcription_id</code>, which you will use in subsequent steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Request VTT conversion</strong>
    <p>Once your SRT-based transcription is registered, convert it to VTT by issuing a format conversion request:</p>
    <pre>curl -X POST "https://api.happyscribe.com/v2/transcriptions/{transcription_id}/formats/vtt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY"</pre>
    <p>Replace <code>{transcription_id}</code> with the actual ID from step 4. The response will include a <code>download_url</code> for the VTT file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Download the VTT file</strong>
    <p>Use the <code>download_url</code> from the previous step to fetch the VTT captions:</p>
    <pre>curl -L "https://cdn.happyscribe.com/vtt/your_file.vtt" -o converted_subtitles.vtt</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edit captions in the subtitle editor</strong>
    <p>Open the downloaded VTT file in the HappyScribe subtitle editor for precise adjustments. You can tweak timing, edit text, and style captions to match your brand guidelines. Then save the final VTT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integrate with your video platform</strong>
    <p>Upload the finalized <code>.vtt</code> file to your video hosting or streaming platform. Most HTML5 players and major CDN services automatically detect and display VTT captions when named <code>video.vtt</code> and linked in the player config.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automate with a script</strong>
    <p>To process multiple files, wrap the above steps into a script. For Node.js, here is a simplified example:</p>
    <pre>
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const API_KEY = process.env.HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY;
const inputDir = './subtitles_to_convert';
const outputDir = './converted_subtitles';

fs.readdirSync(inputDir).forEach(async file => {
  if (path.extname(file) === '.srt') {
    const filePath = path.join(inputDir, file);
    // Upload SRT
    let res = await fetch('https://api.happyscribe.com/v2/transcriptions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
      body: new FormData().append('transcript_file', fs.createReadStream(filePath))
    });
    const { transcription_id } = await res.json();
    // Convert to VTT
    res = await fetch(`https://api.happyscribe.com/v2/transcriptions/${transcription_id}/formats/vtt`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
    });
    const { download_url } = await res.json();
    // Download VTT
    const vttRes = await fetch(download_url);
    const vttText = await vttRes.text();
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(outputDir, file.replace('.srt', '.vtt')), vttText);
    console.log(`Converted ${file} to VTT`);
  }
});
    </pre>
    <p>This script loops through all SRT files, converts each to VTT, and stores the result locally. You can schedule it as a cron job or integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review AI-generated summary</strong>
    <p>If you enable the AI notetaker feature during upload, you receive a concise summary of each video’s content. This helps with metadata, SEO, and quick review. The summary is available via the API or within the HappyScribe dashboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor and manage captions</strong>
    <p>Use the HappyScribe dashboard or API endpoints to track conversion jobs, view status codes, and re-request downloads. Maintain a log of all transcription IDs and timestamps to audit your pipeline and ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

You can script complex workflows in Node.js, Python, Ruby, or any language that supports HTTP requests. With clear documentation, live examples, and predictable rate limits, the API scales effortlessly as your video library grows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Version history and recovery</strong>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multi-language support</strong>
    <p>Whether your platform hosts English, Spanish, German, or Mandarin content, HappyScribe can detect and convert subtitles in over 60 languages. You can even request automatic translation during the conversion process, creating VTT captions in a secondary language without exiting your pipeline.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mini FAQ</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Can I convert multiple SRT files in a single API request?</dt>
