<p>Broadcast television networks and streaming platforms depend on precise, compliant captions to serve diverse audiences and to meet regulatory requirements. Traditionally, closed captions are distributed in SubRip Text (SRT) format due to its simplicity and wide support. However, as more broadcasters embrace web-based delivery and HTML5 players, WebVTT (VTT) has become the de facto standard for on-screen text. Converting SRT to VTT not only ensures compatibility with modern players but also unlocks advanced caption styling, positioning features, and seamless integration into digital workflows. For professional broadcast captioners, a reliable conversion process is essential to maintain accuracy, timing, and accessibility compliance.</p>

<h3>Step-by-step workflow</h3>
<p>This section outlines a detailed, end-to-end process for converting broadcast television captions from SRT to VTT using a combination of tools, scripts, and the HappyScribe API. Whether you are an engineer, editor, or caption specialist, these steps will help you achieve consistent, high-quality results.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Gather your source files</strong>
    <p>Collect the finalized SRT files from your captioning vendor or in-house team. Ensure each file is named consistently, following your project’s naming convention (for example, <code>ShowName_Episode01.srt</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Install the HappyScribe command-line interface</strong>
    <p>HappyScribe offers a CLI tool to streamline conversions. On your local machine or build server, run:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install -g happyscribe-cli</code></pre>
    <p>This installs a global <code>happyscribe</code> command ready for scripting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Authenticate with your API key</strong>
    <p>Obtain your HappyScribe API key from your account dashboard. Set it as an environment variable to secure your credentials:</p>
    <pre><code>export HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload the SRT file</strong>
    <p>Use the CLI to send your SRT file to HappyScribe for conversion:</p>
    <pre><code>happyscribe upload \
  --file ShowName_Episode01.srt \
  --type subtitle \
  --callback-url https://myserver.company.com/webhook</code></pre>
    <p>This command uploads the file and tells HappyScribe to notify your callback URL upon completion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Request VTT conversion via API call</strong>
    <p>Once the upload is processed, you can request a format change. Here is a cURL example:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/convert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input_format": "srt",
    "output_format": "vtt",
    "file_id": "abc123def"
  }'</code></pre>
    <p>Replace <code>file_id</code> with the identifier returned in the upload response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor conversion status</strong>
    <p>Use the following API endpoint to check on progress:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X GET \
  "https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/abc123def/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY"</code></pre>
    <p>Wait until the status is marked <code>completed</code>. You can also configure webhooks for push notifications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Download the VTT file</strong>
    <p>Once conversion is done, fetch the converted file:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -L \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/abc123def/download?format=vtt" \
  -o ShowName_Episode01.vtt</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review and edit in the subtitle editor</strong>
    <p>Open the downloaded VTT in the HappyScribe subtitle editor to fine-tune formatting, check timing adjustments, correct speaker labels, and validate compliance with FCC guidelines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integrate into your automation pipeline</strong>
    <p>Embed these steps in your CI/CD or broadcast automation system. With HappyScribe’s API, you can convert multiple files in parallel, set up triggers for new uploads, and automatically archive final VTT files to your distribution server or CDN.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Mini FAQ</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Q: What is the difference between SRT and VTT for broadcast captions?</dt>
  <dd>A: SRT is a simple subtitle container with start/end times and text. VTT extends SRT with styling, positioning, voice identifiers, and chapter metadata, making it ideal for HTML5 players and advanced caption requirements. It also supports WebVTT notes and region definitions for accessibility enhancements.</dd>

  <dt>Q: Can I automate SRT to VTT conversion for a nightly broadcast ingest?</dt>
  <dd>A: Yes. Use the HappyScribe API or CLI in a scheduled script or CI/CD task. Configure environment variables for authentication, monitor job statuses via webhooks or polling, then download and distribute the final VTT files to your broadcast servers or CDN automatically.</dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I ensure FCC compliance when converting captions?</dt>
  <dd>A: The HappyScribe subtitle editor enforces style guidelines, line limits, and cue durations. Our automated validation flags potential violations, such as overlapping captions or excessive character counts. You can also apply predefined templates designed for FCC closed caption rules.</dd>
