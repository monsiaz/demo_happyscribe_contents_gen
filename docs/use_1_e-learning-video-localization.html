<p>The global e-learning market is expanding at an unprecedented pace. Organizations, universities, and independent instructors alike are striving to deliver high-quality educational content to learners across diverse geographies and language backgrounds. One of the fundamental building blocks of accessible, inclusive, and localized online learning is accurate and compatible subtitles. Although SubRip Text (SRT) is a widely adopted subtitle format, many modern e-learning platforms, video players, and streaming environments prefer Web Video Text Tracks (VTT) for advanced styling, positioning, and browser compatibility.</p>
<p>Converting SRT to VTT ensures your learners on platforms such as HTML5 players, modern browsers, and mobile devices receive the best possible viewing and reading experience. VTT supports features like metadata cues, styling tags, and event tracking that are essential for interactive e-learning modules, quizzes embedded in video timelines, and navigable transcripts. In addition, VTT can integrate with JavaScript APIs to trigger chapter markers, glossary pop-ups, and other dynamic learning aids—all crucial elements in a cutting-edge e-learning environment.</p>
<p>To stay ahead in the competitive e-learning landscape, instructional designers and localization teams must adopt a streamlined, reliable workflow to convert and enhance subtitle files. By leveraging HappyScribe’s industry-leading API, subtitle editor, AI notetaker, and collaboration tools, you can automate repetitive tasks, maintain accuracy across multiple languages, and deliver a seamless learner experience worldwide.</p>

<h3>Step-by-step workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Gather source SRT files</strong>
    <p>Begin by exporting the original SRT captions from your video authoring tool or learning management system (LMS). Ensure that each SRT file corresponds to a specific language variant—English, Spanish, French, etc. Organize them in a dedicated folder structure, for example:</p>
    <pre>e-learning-project/
  subtitles/
    en/
      module1.srt
      module2.srt
    es/
      module1.srt
      module2.srt
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validate SRT file integrity</strong>
    <p>Before conversion, check for common errors such as overlapping timestamps, missing sequence numbers, or malformed entries. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/Max-Koehler/SRT-Validator">SRT Validator</a> or a simple custom Python script can help identify issues:</p>
    <pre>
from pysrt import open as open_srt

def validate_srt(path):
    subs = open_srt(path)
    errors = []
    for index, sub in enumerate(subs):
        if index > 0 and sub.start <= subs[index-1].end:
            errors.append(f"Overlap at index {index}")
    return errors

print(validate_srt("module1.srt"))
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create a HappyScribe account and retrieve your API key</strong>
    <p>Sign up at HappyScribe.com and navigate to your dashboard. Under <em>API settings</em>, generate a new API key. Keep this key secure, as it authorizes all your automated interactions with HappyScribe services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Import SRT via the HappyScribe API</strong>
    <p>Use a simple HTTP request to upload and convert your file. Here’s an example using <code>curl</code>:</p>
    <pre>
curl -X POST https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@path/to/module1.srt" \
  -F "source_language=en" \
  -F "format=srt"
</pre>
    <p>The API response returns a <code>transcription_id</code> which you will use in subsequent calls. This step creates a new project in your HappyScribe workspace and preps the file for editing and conversion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open the subtitle editor to review and refine timings</strong>
    <p>Log in to HappyScribe, locate your project by <code>transcription_id</code>, and launch the integrated <strong>subtitle editor</strong>. The visual timeline interface displays waveform schematics, text segments, and timecodes. This is your chance to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure accurate synchronization between speech and captions.</li>
      <li>Correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar.</li>
      <li>Adjust line breaks for readability on small screens.</li>
      <li>Add speaker labels or styling cues using WebVTT markup (e.g., <code>&lt;c.class&gt;</code> tags).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Leverage the AI notetaker for content breakdown</strong>
    <p>Activate HappyScribe’s <strong>AI notetaker</strong> feature to generate concise summaries and key points for each chapter in your e-learning video. These notes can be repurposed as lesson highlights, quiz questions, or handout material. Simply click <em>Generate notes</em> in the editor and let the AI extract timestamps, definitions, and action items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Export the refined file as VTT using the API or UI</strong>
    <p>Once you are satisfied with the edits, you can export directly from the UI by selecting <em>Export &gt; WebVTT (.vtt)</em>. Alternatively, use the API for batch automation:</p>
    <pre>
curl -X GET https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions/TRANSCRIPTION_ID/export \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -G --data-urlencode "format=vtt" \
  -o module1.vtt
</pre>
    <p>This command fetches your converted file as <code>module1.vtt</code>, ready for upload to your e-learning platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integrate VTT into your e-learning platform</strong>
    <p>Whether your LMS is Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, or a custom-built portal, most modern systems support WebVTT. In an HTML5 video tag, it looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;video controls&gt;
  &lt;source src="module1.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
  &lt;track kind="subtitles" src="module1.vtt" srclang="en" label="English"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>
    <p>Repeat the integration for each language track—<code>es</code>, <code>fr</code>, <code>de</code>—to provide multilingual support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automate future conversions with a script</strong>
    <p>Save time on subsequent modules by scripting the entire pipeline. Below is a simplified Python example using <code>requests</code>:</p>
    <pre>
import requests
import os

API_URL = "https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions"
API_KEY = os.getenv("HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY")

def convert_srt_to_vtt(file_path, language_code):
    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        response = requests.post(
            API_URL,
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
            files={"file": f},
            data={"source_language": language_code, "format": "srt"},
        )
    transcription_id = response.json()["id"]
    export_url = f"{API_URL}/{transcription_id}/export"
    export_params = {"format": "vtt"}
    export_resp = requests.get(
        export_url,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
        params=export_params,
    )
    output_path = file_path.replace(".srt", ".vtt")
    with open(output_path, "wb") as out_f:
        out_f.write(export_resp.content)
    print(f"Converted {file_path} to {output_path}")

# Batch process all SRTs in a folder
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("subtitles"):
    for name in files:
        if name.endswith(".srt"):
            path = os.path.join(root, name)
            lang = os.path.basename(root)
            convert_srt_to_vtt(path, lang)
</pre>
    <p>This script automatically processes any .srt file in your project tree and outputs .vtt files in the same locations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Mini FAQ</h3>
<h4>Can I convert multiple SRT files to VTT in one batch?</h4>
<p>Yes. By using the HappyScribe API, you can automate batch conversions. A sample Python script provided above demonstrates how to iterate over a folder of SRT files, upload each one, and download the corresponding VTT output. For large-scale projects, you might integrate this step into your CI/CD pipeline or cloud function.</p>

<h4>Is the timing data preserved when converting SRT to VTT?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. HappyScribe retains all timestamp information during the conversion. If you have manually adjusted cues in the subtitle editor—whether it’s trimming intervals for readability or syncing with dubbed audio—those edits carry over to the final VTT file without drift or loss of precision.</p>

<h4>How do I handle styling and speaker labels in the VTT format?</h4>
<p>WebVTT supports class-based styling tags such as <code>&lt;c.class&gt;Text&lt;/c&gt;</code> and note cues for speaker identification. You can insert these tags directly in the subtitle editor or include them programmatically via the API. When your e-learning platform uses a custom CSS file, you can target your <code>.class</code> selectors for font, color, and position adjustments.</p>
