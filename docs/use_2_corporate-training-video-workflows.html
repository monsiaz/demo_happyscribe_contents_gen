<p>In today’s fast-paced corporate environment, organizations rely on video-based training to onboard new employees, deliver compliance courses, and share best practices. Accessible, searchable, and easily integrated captions are critical to ensuring every team member benefits from your training content. SRT (SubRip Subtitle) files are widely used for basic caption support. However, VTT (WebVTT) is the modern standard for web-based players and eLearning platforms. Converting SRT to VTT unlocks advanced styling, chapter markers, and platform compatibility that are essential for a seamless learning experience across desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>For corporate training video workflows, SRT to VTT conversion boosts accessibility, supports internationalization, and unlocks integrations with LMS (Learning Management Systems) like Moodle, Canvas, and corporate intranet portals. VTT supports metadata cues, which allows instructional designers to add chapters, descriptions, and interactive quizzes directly in the caption file. This extra layer of structure transforms static subtitles into dynamic learning aids that improve knowledge retention and engagement.</p>
<p>Whether you have a library of legacy training assets or you produce new video courses every quarter, adopting an efficient, automated SRT to VTT process will save hours of manual work, reduce errors, and ensure compliance with accessibility regulations such as ADA and WCAG. By leveraging HappyScribe’s powerful API and intuitive subtitle editor, your team can streamline conversion, fine-tune captions, and integrate transcripts directly into your LMS or video hosting platform.</p>

<h3>Step-by-step workflow for SRT to VTT conversion</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Prepare your SRT files</h4>
    <p>Gather all existing SRT files for your training videos. Verify each file has accurate timecodes and text. If you do not have SRT files yet, record or export transcripts using HappyScribe’s transcription API or subtitle editor. Store these files in a dedicated folder structure named by course title, module number, and language code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Install command line tools</h4>
    <p>Ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Node.js (version 14+)</li>
      <li>Python 3.7+</li>
      <li>curl or HTTPie for API calls</li>
      <li>ffmpeg for video preview (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These tools will allow you to run scripts, call the HappyScribe API, and test your converted VTT files against sample video segments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Obtain HappyScribe API credentials</h4>
    <p>Log in to your HappyScribe account and navigate to the API section. Create a new API token with the following scopes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>transcript:upload</li>
      <li>transcript:convert</li>
      <li>transcript:download</li>
      <li>subtitle:editor_access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Copy the token securely and set it as an environment variable on your system:</p>
    <p><code>export HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY=your_api_token_here</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Upload SRT files via API</h4>
    <p>Use a Node.js or Python script to upload the SRT file for conversion. Below is a Node.js example:</p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function uploadSrt(filePath) {
  const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  const response = await fetch('https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
    },
    body: new FormData().append('file', fileStream).append('format', 'srt')
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.id;
}

uploadSrt('./training_module1.srt').then(id => console.log('Uploaded transcript id:', id));
</code></pre>
    <p>This call returns a unique transcript ID you will use for conversion and download.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Convert SRT to VTT using the API</h4>
    <p>Once the file is uploaded, initiate the conversion process:</p>
    <pre><code>const convertTranscript = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions/${id}/convert`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ target_format: 'vtt' })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.status;
};

convertTranscript('your_transcript_id').then(status => console.log('Conversion status:', status));</code></pre>
    <p>Poll the transcript endpoint to check when conversion is complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Download the converted VTT file</h4>
    <p>After the status shows “completed,” retrieve the VTT file:</p>
    <pre><code>const downloadVtt = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions/${id}/download?format=vtt`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY}` }
  });
  const vttContent = await response.text();
  require('fs').writeFileSync('./training_module1.vtt', vttContent);
  console.log('VTT file saved.');
};

downloadVtt('your_transcript_id');</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Fine-tune captions with the subtitle editor</h4>
    <p>Open the new VTT file in HappyScribe’s subtitle editor. Adjust timing, correct any transcription errors, and add chapter markers or descriptions directly in cue metadata. Use keyboard shortcuts to edit quickly and preview changes against the video.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Integrate VTT into your LMS or video platform</h4>
    <p>Upload the finalized VTT file to your corporate LMS, video hosting service, or internal portal. Ensure captions are enabled by default and linked to specific video IDs or modules for seamless playback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Automate with scripts for batch processing</h4>
    <p>If you have dozens or hundreds of modules, wrap the upload, conversion, download, and save steps in a shell script or CI pipeline. Schedule nightly runs to process new SRT files. Send notifications to your team when files are ready for review in the subtitle editor.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
