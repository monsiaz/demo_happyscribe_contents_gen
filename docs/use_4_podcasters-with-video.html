<p>Podcasters who incorporate video often rely on subtitles to make their content accessible to a broader audience. While SRT is a common subtitle format, many modern video players and web platforms require VTT (WebVTT) to synchronize captions correctly with HTML5 video. Converting SRT to VTT ensures your video chapters, speaker labels, and timecodes display perfectly across every device. Whether you host episodes on your own website, on YouTube, or on streaming platforms, having a VTT file improves compatibility, search engine optimization, and viewer engagement.</p>
<p>For professional podcasters, minutes of setup time translate into lost opportunities for listeners and sponsors. Manually editing timecodes and formats can introduce errors such as misaligned captions or missing speaker tags. An automated, precise conversion from SRT to VTT saves hours per episode and prevents costly mistakes. With HappyScribe’s reliable tools and API integration, you can streamline your subtitle workflow and focus on what matters most—delivering high-quality audio-visual content that resonates with your audience.</p>

<h3>Step-by-step workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepare your SRT file</strong>
    <p>Export your raw subtitles from your video editing software. If you record in Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve, go to the Subtitles panel and choose “Export SRT.” Review the file in a text editor to ensure speaker labels and timestamps are correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Set up your environment</strong>
    <p>Install necessary tools and libraries. You will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cURL or HTTP client (for API calls)</li>
      <li>A scripting language like Python or Node.js</li>
      <li>A HappyScribe API key (sign up for a free trial at HappyScribe.com)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload and convert with HappyScribe API</strong>
    <p>Use the following cURL command or script snippet to upload your SRT file and request conversion to VTT:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/convert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your-file.srt" \
  -F "source_format=srt" \
  -F "target_format=vtt" \
  -o output.vtt</code></pre>
    <p>In Node.js you could use:</p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const FormData = require('form-data');

async function convert() {
  const form = new FormData();
  form.append('file', fs.createReadStream('your-file.srt'));
  form.append('source_format', 'srt');
  form.append('target_format', 'vtt');

  const res = await fetch('https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/convert', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
    body: form
  });

  const buffer = await res.buffer();
  fs.writeFileSync('output.vtt', buffer);
  console.log('VTT file saved as output.vtt');
}

convert();</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review and edit with our subtitle editor</strong>
    <p>Log into HappyScribe and open the subtitle editor. Import the VTT file if you prefer a visual interface. Use the timeline scrubber to check alignment, correct typos, and adjust speaker names. The subtitle editor highlights overlapping cues, missing punctuation, and length issues in real time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhance with AI notetaker</strong>
    <p>If you want to create show notes or timestamps, use the AI notetaker feature. It automatically extracts key topics, generates a structured summary, and timestamps each point. Copy these notes directly into your podcast show notes or blog post to boost SEO and engagement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Export final VTT and integrate</strong>
    <p>Once edits are complete, export the finalized VTT file from the editor. Upload it to your hosting platform or attach it in your HTML5 video tag like this:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;video controls&gt;
  &lt;source src="episode.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
  &lt;track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="output.vtt" default&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This code snippet ensures cross-browser compatibility and SEO benefits by making your captions indexable by search engines.</p>
