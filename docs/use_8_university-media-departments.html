<p>Universities today rely on digital video content for lectures, campus news, research presentations, and student-made documentaries. To ensure seamless playback and accessibility across modern browsers and video players, media departments must often convert SubRip Subtitle files (SRT) into Web Video Text Tracks files (VTT). While SRT is a widely recognized format, VTT offers enhanced features such as styling cues, positioning, and compatibility with HTML5 &lt;track&gt; elements. By moving from SRT to VTT, university media teams can improve accessibility for students with disabilities, streamline integration with learning management systems (LMS), and deliver a consistent viewing experience across desktop and mobile platforms.</p>

<h3>Benefits of converting SRT to VTT for university videos</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML5 compatibility</strong> – VTT is natively supported by modern browsers, making it easy to embed captions without additional plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced styling</strong> – VTT supports text alignment, font styling, and positioning cues that let media teams create professional, branded caption tracks.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility compliance</strong> – VTT meets WCAG guidelines, ensuring content remains accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing students.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-platform support</strong> – From desktop browsers to mobile apps and smart TVs, VTT ensures captions render consistently regardless of the device.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive transcripts</strong> – VTT can double as an interactive transcript, making it easier for students to search specific passages in lectures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step by step workflow</h3>
<p>The following workflow shows how a university media department can efficiently convert batches of SRT files to VTT using local tools, simple scripts, and the HappyScribe API. This process can be fully automated and integrated into your existing media pipeline.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Collect source SRT files.</strong>
    <p>Gather all SRT subtitle files from your media storage. This may include lecture recordings, guest speaker events, and promotional videos. Ensure each file is named to match its corresponding video identifier (for example, <code>lecture_101.srt</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Install conversion tools.</strong>
    <p>On a local workstation or server, install FFmpeg for quick command-line conversion and a scripting language such as Python or Bash for batch processing.</p>
    <p>Example FFmpeg install on Ubuntu:</p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Write a batch script.</strong>
    <p>Create a simple Bash or Python script to loop through your SRT files and convert each one to VTT using FFmpeg or a custom parser. Below is a Bash example using FFmpeg:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p vtt_output
for file in *.srt; do
  base=$(basename "$file" .srt)
  ffmpeg -i "$file" "vtt_output/${base}.vtt"
done</code></pre>
    <p>This approach works well for small jobs, but for larger projects or cloud-based workflows, turn to the HappyScribe API for high reliability and advanced features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Set up your HappyScribe API account.</strong>
    <p>Sign up for an API key at the HappyScribe dashboard. Store your <code>API_KEY</code> as an environment variable to keep it secure.</p>
    <pre><code>export HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make an API call to convert SRT to VTT.</strong>
    <p>Use a simple curl or HTTP client to send your SRT file to HappyScribe and request a VTT conversion. The API handles parsing, validation, and formatting automatically.</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/convert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY" \
  -F "source=@path/to/lecture_101.srt" \
  -F "format=vtt" \
  -o lecture_101.vtt</code></pre>
    <p>For bulk jobs, loop through your SRT folder:</p>
    <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
for file in *.srt; do
  base=$(basename "$file" .srt)
  curl -s -X POST https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/subtitles/convert \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY" \
    -F "source=@$file" \
    -F "format=vtt" \
    -o "vtt_output/${base}.vtt"
done</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review and edit in the HappyScribe subtitle editor.</strong>
    <p>After conversion, log into the HappyScribe web app to access the built-in subtitle editor. Make any final timing adjustments, correct typos, or add speaker labels. Its intuitive interface saves hours compared to manual text editing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Leverage AI notetaker for enhanced transcripts.</strong>
    <p>For lectures and research seminars, activate the AI notetaker feature. This generates bullet-point summaries and key takeaways alongside your VTT files. Students can quickly scan topics before watching full videos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integrate VTT files into your LMS or streaming platform.</strong>
    <p>Upload the final .vtt files to Canvas, Blackboard, Kaltura, or your campus streaming server. Ensure each video’s metadata correctly references the VTT file path for automatic caption loading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automate reporting and compliance.</strong>
    <p>Use the API to track conversion statistics, file sizes, and user edits. HappyScribe’s reporting endpoints let you export logs to CSV or JSON, so you can demonstrate ADA compliance and accessibility metrics.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
