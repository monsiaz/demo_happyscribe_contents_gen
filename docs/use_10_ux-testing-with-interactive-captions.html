<p>User experience testing has evolved far beyond basic click tracking and heatmaps. Today’s interactive prototypes and video walkthroughs demand precise timecoded captions that can respond to user input, pause on hover, trigger events, and integrate seamlessly with your testing platform. SRT files offer a simple way to attach captions to your videos, but they lack support for styling options, cue settings, and JavaScript event hooks. VTT (WebVTT) is the standard for web video captions. It extends basic subtitle text with CSS styling, cue positioning, metadata, and the ability to fire DOM events. If you’re conducting UX testing that includes accessibility checks, readability studies, or interactive walkthroughs, converting your SRT to VTT is a must. That conversion step unlocks interactive captions so you can gather richer insights, create more engaging prototypes, and validate real user behavior under realistic conditions.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a video prototype demonstrating a new onboarding flow. You want to test whether users notice key screens, how long they spend reading instructions, and whether interactive hints catch their eye. By using VTT instead of SRT, you can assign unique IDs to each caption cue, attach CSS classes for highlighting, and bind click or hover events that track user interactions. You can even overlay survey prompts or micro-surveys at specific timecodes. All of that is impossible with plain SRT.</p>
<p>This is where a reliable, automated SRT to VTT conversion service becomes essential. You need a tool that scales across dozens of videos, integrates into your existing scripts, and delivers accurate, compliant WebVTT files without manual cleanup. HappyScribe provides a robust API, an inline subtitle editor, and AI-driven tools that let you streamline your entire caption conversion process. In the following sections, we’ll show you how to build a step-by-step workflow, highlight key HappyScribe features, and answer common questions so you can kick off UX testing with interactive captions in minutes.</p>

<h3>Step-by-step workflow for UX testing with interactive captions</h3>
<p>Below is a detailed workflow that covers each phase of converting SRT to VTT, integrating interactive captions into your prototype or testing platform, and leveraging user feedback. This workflow assumes you have a folder of SRT files generated from your video prototypes or test recordings. You can adapt the commands and code snippets to your preferred language and environment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepare your SRT files</strong>
    <p>Gather all SRT subtitles exported from your recording tool or generated by transcription software. Make sure the filenames match your video assets (for example, <code>onboarding-flow.srt</code> next to <code>onboarding-flow.mp4</code>). Organize them in a folder structure like:</p>
    <pre><code>project-root/
  videos/
    onboarding-flow.mp4
    feature-demo.mp4
  subtitles/
    onboarding-flow.srt
    feature-demo.srt
</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Install the HappyScribe CLI or SDK</strong>
    <p>HappyScribe offers a command line interface (CLI) and native SDKs for Node.js, Python, Ruby, and more. For Node.js, install via npm:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install @happyscribe/api</code></pre>
    <p>Or for Python, install via pip:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install happyscribe-sdk</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Obtain your API key</strong>
    <p>Log in to your HappyScribe account and navigate to the API section. Generate a new API key with conversion permissions. Store it securely in an environment variable:</p>
    <pre><code>export HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Write a conversion script</strong>
    <p>Create a script that loops through each SRT file, calls the HappyScribe API to convert it to WebVTT, and saves the result. Here’s an example in Node.js:</p>
    <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { HappyScribe } = require('@happyscribe/api');

const apiKey = process.env.HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY;
const client = new HappyScribe({ apiKey });

async function convertSrtToVtt(inputDir, outputDir) {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(inputDir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.srt'));
  for (const file of files) {
    const srtPath = path.join(inputDir, file);
    const vttPath = path.join(outputDir, file.replace('.srt', '.vtt'));

    const srtContent = fs.readFileSync(srtPath, 'utf8');
    const response = await client.convert({
      format: 'vtt',
      content: srtContent
    });

    fs.writeFileSync(vttPath, response.convertedText);
    console.log(`Converted ${file} to ${vttPath}`);
  }
}

convertSrtToVtt('./subtitles', './converted-vtt').catch(console.error);
</code></pre>
    <p>This script uses the <code>convert</code> method on the HappyScribe client. It accepts the source text and target format, then returns the converted text in WebVTT syntax.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Integrate VTT into your testing platform</strong>
    <p>Once you have your <code>.vtt</code> files in the <code>converted-vtt</code> folder, point your video player or prototype framework to load the correct caption tracks. For example, if you use a HTML5 video player:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;video id="ux-test-video" controls&gt;
  &lt;source src="videos/onboarding-flow.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
  &lt;track 
    kind="subtitles" 
    src="converted-vtt/onboarding-flow.vtt" 
    srclang="en" 
    label="English interactive captions" 
    default&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>With WebVTT in place, you can now add JavaScript to bind events or style captions via CSS:</p>
    <pre><code>const video = document.getElementById('ux-test-video');
const track = video.textTracks[0];
track.mode = 'hidden'; // load cues but do not display default browser captions

track.oncuechange = () =&gt; {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; track.cues.length; i++) {
    const cue = track.cues[i];
    const id = cue.id; // if you assigned IDs in VTT file
    if (cue.active) {
      console.log('Active cue', id, cue.text);
      // Insert custom UI element or trigger survey prompt
    }
  }
};
</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Annotate findings with AI notetaker</strong>
    <p>Run your user tests while capturing feedback. HappyScribe’s AI notetaker can automatically generate timecoded notes and to-do items based on participants’ comments. After your testing session, upload your meeting recording or transcript to HappyScribe’s AI notetaker endpoint:</p>
    <pre><code>const { HappyScribe } = require('@happyscribe/api');
const client = new HappyScribe({ apiKey: process.env.HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY });

async function generateMeetingNotes(fileUrl) {
  const result = await client.aiNotetaker({
    fileUrl: fileUrl,
    features: ['topic-detection', 'action-items', 'summary']
  });
  console.log('AI notes:', result.notes);
}

generateMeetingNotes('https://yourstorage.com/test-session.mp4');
</code></pre>
    <p>This step gives you structured insights like key pain points, questions to follow up on, and action items that directly reference the timestamped captions you tested.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Iterate based on feedback</strong>
    <p>Use the combined data from your interactive caption logs and AI-generated notes to refine your captions, adjust timing, or reposition cues for maximum clarity. Rerun your conversion script to update any modified SRT files and push new VTT files into your testing environment. Repeat your UX tests until you achieve optimal readability, accessibility, and user engagement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>How HappyScribe features improve your workflow</h3>
<p>HappyScribe offers a suite of tools designed to streamline every stage of your subtitle and transcript conversion process. Here are three key features that directly impact the UX testing workflow described above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Subtitle editor</strong>
    <p>The online subtitle editor lets you visually review and tweak your captions before conversion. You can adjust start and end times, split or merge cues, and assign unique cue IDs for event tracking. The editor supports both SRT and VTT formats, so you can verify WebVTT syntax directly in the UI before exporting or feeding into your API script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>AI notetaker</strong>
    <p>Rather than manually sifting through test session recordings, the AI notetaker automatically identifies key topics, user pain points, and action items. Its output is timecoded and linked to your video or transcript, allowing you to cross-reference user feedback with specific caption cues. This accelerates analysis and ensures you don’t miss critical insights that inform your interactive caption design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>API first approach</strong>
    <p>HappyScribe’s REST API handles both transcription and format conversion. With simple endpoints for converting SRT to VTT, generating subtitles, or creating AI-driven notes, you can integrate HappyScribe directly into your CI/CD pipeline, design system, or automation scripts. This means zero manual overhead, batch processing for hundreds of files, and full control over versioning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Team collaboration</strong>
    <p>Invite designers, developers, and QA specialists to your HappyScribe project. Assign roles, leave in-app comments on captions, and track revision history. This collaborative layer ensures everyone stays aligned on interactive caption requirements and implementation details, from accessibility auditors to front end engineers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Export and integration options</strong>
    <p>In addition to VTT, HappyScribe supports export to formats like TTML, DFXP, and JSON. If your testing platform requires custom metadata or nonstandard cues, you can convert SRT to JSON via the API and then transform it into your target format with a custom script. This flexibility covers even the most specialized interactive caption use cases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mini FAQ for UX testing with interactive captions</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>What are the main advantages of VTT over SRT for interactive captions?</dt>
  <dd>WebVTT supports CSS styling, cue positioning, metadata headers, and JavaScript event hooks. This allows you to highlight captions, trigger callbacks when cues become active, and attach custom IDs for analytics. SRT is limited to plain text and basic timing, making interactive features impossible.</dd>
  <dt>Can I automate batch conversion of hundreds of SRT files at once?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Using the HappyScribe API or CLI, you can script batch conversions in any language. Our example Node.js and Python snippets show how to loop through a directory of SRT files, call the API, and save VTT results. You can integrate this into your CI pipeline or run it on-demand.</dd>
  <dt>How does AI notetaker tie into UX testing with captions?</dt>
  <dd>The AI notetaker processes your recorded test sessions and transcripts to extract key insights. It provides a timecoded summary that references when participants interacted with specific captions. This helps you correlate user behavior with exact caption cues and refine timing or copy based on real feedback.</dd>
