<p>As an accessibility consultant, you are on the front line of ensuring digital media is inclusive, compliant, and user-friendly. Video content is a cornerstone of modern communication and training, but it is not automatically accessible to all audiences. SubRip Text (SRT) remains one of the most popular caption formats due to its simplicity and wide adoption. However, for HTML5 video players, e-learning platforms, and modern web applications, Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT or VTT) is the industry standard. Converting SRT to VTT is essential to meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines, Section 508 requirements, and to guarantee that captions render correctly across browsers, native video players, and mobile devices. A seamless SRT to VTT conversion process empowers you to deliver flawless captioning, streamline audits, and maintain consistency across all client projects.</p>

<h3>workflow overview</h3>
<p>This step-by-step workflow outlines how accessibility consultants can leverage the power of HappyScribe’s API, subtitle editor, and AI notetaker to automate SRT to VTT conversion, refine captions, and integrate results into client deliverables.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Gather source files and requirements</strong>
    <p>Start by collecting all SRT files provided by your client or generated by transcription services. Verify language codes, timecode formats, and any special requirements such as speaker labels, sound descriptions, or extended metadata (for example, music cues or non-speech audio descriptions).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Set up your HappyScribe account and API key</strong>
    <p>If you haven’t already, register for a professional plan on HappyScribe. Navigate to your account settings to generate an API key. Store this key securely—ideally in an environment variable or a secure credentials manager—so you can authenticate programmatic requests without exposing sensitive tokens in your scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload SRT via API or web interface</strong>
    <p>You can either use the web interface for one-off files or employ a script for bulk processing. With the web UI, simply drag and drop SRT files into the Subtitle Editor. For automation, use the HappyScribe API’s /transcriptions endpoint to upload your SRT file and specify your desired output format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Convert SRT to VTT</strong>
    <p>Using the HappyScribe API, invoke the conversion service. Specify format=vtt in your request parameters. HappyScribe’s backend will parse SRT cues, preserve timecodes, and generate a WebVTT file compliant with the standard spec. Optionally, choose advanced flags such as speaker diarization or keyword extraction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Refine captions in the subtitle editor</strong>
    <p>Open the converted VTT in HappyScribe’s online subtitle editor. Make manual adjustments, tweak timings by fractions of a second, add or correct speaker labels, and insert accessibility descriptions for non-speech elements (e.g., [door opens], [applause]). The editor provides waveform visualizations and timecode alignment tools for pixel-perfect accuracy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Leverage AI notetaker for context and summaries</strong>
    <p>If your client requires summaries, action items, or keyword lists alongside captions, use HappyScribe’s AI notetaker feature. With a single click, generate structured notes in markdown or plain text. Insert them into project documentation or deliver them as supplemental accessibility artifacts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Download finalized VTT and integrate</strong>
    <p>Once editing is complete, export the VTT file. Embed it in your HTML5 video player using the &lt;track&gt; tag, or upload it to your LMS or video hosting platform. If you manage multiple videos, automate this final download step using the API’s file export endpoint to bulk-retrieve assets into your project folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Test across platforms</strong>
    <p>Validate captions in popular browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and on mobile devices. Use assistive technology—screen readers and captions toggles—to confirm that cues appear correctly, that text is legible, and that any embedded descriptions are properly announced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Deliver audit report</strong>
    <p>Compile an accessibility audit report, including VTT samples, summary notes from the AI notetaker, and any required remediation recommendations. Present this to stakeholders as proof of compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA or Section 508 standards.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>tools and scripts for seamless conversion</h3>
<p>Automation is key for accessibility consultants managing multiple client projects. HappyScribe’s robust API combined with scripts or command-line tools can save hours of manual work. Below are examples in Bash/cURL and Python to kickstart your integration.</p>

<h4>bash and cURL example</h4>
<p>This script uploads an SRT file, requests a VTT conversion, polls for completion, and downloads the resulting file. Save it as convert_srt_to_vtt.sh and grant execute permissions (<code>chmod +x</code>).</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Configuration
API_KEY="YOUR_HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY"
INPUT_FILE="input_caption.srt"
OUTPUT_FILE="output_caption.vtt"

# Step 1: Initiate transcription/conversion
response=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@${INPUT_FILE}" \
  -F "format=vtt")

# Extract job ID
job_id=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.id')
echo "Conversion job created: $job_id"

# Step 2: Poll for completion
while true; do
  status=$(curl -s -X GET https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions/$job_id \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" | jq -r '.status')
  echo "Current status: $status"
  if [[ "$status" == "completed" ]]; then
    break
  elif [[ "$status" == "error" ]]; then
    echo "Error during conversion"
    exit 1
  fi
  sleep 5
done

# Step 3: Download VTT file
curl -s -X GET https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions/$job_id/download?format=vtt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -o $OUTPUT_FILE

echo "Downloaded VTT to $OUTPUT_FILE"</code></pre>

<h4>python example</h4>
<p>Use this Python snippet to achieve the same result. Install dependencies with <code>pip install requests</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import time
import requests

API_KEY = os.getenv("HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY")
INPUT_FILE = "input_caption.srt"
OUTPUT_FILE = "output_caption.vtt"
BASE_URL = "https://api.happyscribe.com/v1"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
}

# Step 1: upload and convert
with open(INPUT_FILE, "rb") as f:
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/transcriptions",
        headers=headers,
        files={"file": f},
        data={"format": "vtt"}
    )
response.raise_for_status()
job_id = response.json()["id"]
print(f"Started job {job_id}")

# Step 2: poll status
status = ""
while status not in ("completed", "error"):
    res = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/transcriptions/{job_id}", headers=headers)
    res.raise_for_status()
    status = res.json()["status"]
    print(f"Status: {status}")
    if status == "error":
        raise RuntimeError("Conversion failed")
    time.sleep(5)

# Step 3: download file
download_url = f"{BASE_URL}/transcriptions/{job_id}/download?format=vtt"
res = requests.get(download_url, headers=headers)
res.raise_for_status()
with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "wb") as f:
    f.write(res.content)
print(f"VTT saved to {OUTPUT_FILE}")</code></pre>
<p>Customize these scripts to process directories of files, integrate with your CI/CD pipeline, or trigger automated reporting once all conversions are done.</p>

<h3>mini faq</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Can HappyScribe preserve speaker labels during SRT to VTT conversion?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. If your SRT file contains speaker labels, HappyScribe’s conversion process will retain them. You can further refine or adjust these labels in the subtitle editor before exporting the final VTT.</dd>
  <dt>Is it possible to convert multiple files at once?</dt>
  <dd>Absolutely. By scripting against the HappyScribe API or using our command-line tools, you can batch upload and process dozens or hundreds of files in a single automated run.</dd>
  <dt>How do I include audio descriptions or non-speech elements?</dt>
  <dd>Use HappyScribe’s subtitle editor to insert custom tags or annotations such as [door opens] or [background music]. These descriptions will be embedded in your final VTT and announced by most modern media players and assistive technologies.</dd>
