    "content": "<h1>convert srt to vtt with HappyScribe</h1>\n\n<p>Welcome to a guide that will show you how to convert SRT to VTT files quickly and accurately. Whether you are a developer, a video producer or a content creator you’ll learn the essentials behind these formats and how to switch from .srt to .vtt in a few steps.</p>\n\n<h2>what are srt and vtt formats?</h2>\n\n<p>SRT, or SubRip Text, is a simple text file that stores subtitles with timecodes. It is widely used for offline media players and basic editing tools. VTT, or WebVTT, is designed for HTML5 video. It adds support for styling cues and is the standard for modern browsers and video platforms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key differences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>SRT uses hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds</li>\n  <li>VTT uses hours:minutes:seconds.milliseconds</li>\n  <li>VTT lets you add classes and voice tags</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>why you might need to convert srt to vtt</h2>\n\n<p>Moving from SRT to VTT ensures your captions work on websites and streaming services that rely on HTML5. By switching formats you can:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>enable styling like font, color and position</li>\n  <li>improve compatibility with web players</li>\n  <li>use advanced caption features via Subtitle editor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>how to convert srt to vtt with ffmpeg</h2>\n\n<p>FFmpeg is a powerful command-line tool that can convert many media formats. To convert a single file from SRT to VTT use:</p>\n<pre><code>ffmpeg -i subtitles.srt subtitles.vtt</code></pre>\n\n<p>For a batch of files on Mac or Linux:</p>\n<pre><code>for file in *.srt; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$file\" \"${file%.srt}.vtt\"\ndone</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you have HappyScribe API access you can automate this step and integrate conversion with your existing workflows.</p>\n\n<h2>how to convert srt to vtt using Python scripts</h2>\n\n<p>A quick Python snippet can read an SRT and write a VTT:</p>\n<pre><code>import pysrt\n\nsubs = pysrt.open('subtitles.srt')\nwith open('subtitles.vtt', 'w') as vtt:\n  vtt.write('WEBVTT\\n\\n')\n  for idx, sub in enumerate(subs, 1):\n    start = sub.start.to_time().isoformat()[:-3]\n    end = sub.end.to_time().isoformat()[:-3]\n    vtt.write(f'{idx}\\n{start} --> {end}\\n{sub.text}\\n\\n')</code></pre>\n\n<p>This script uses the pysrt library to handle timecode parsing. You can tweak it for more style tags or add a caption generator for custom cues.</p>\n\n<h2>what are your options for free online conversion</h2>\n\n<p>You can convert SRT to VTT online free using several tools. If you prefer a manual route you can open your SRT in a text editor, change commas to dots in timecodes and add a <strong>WEBVTT</strong> header at the top. For an automated workflow consider HappyScribe’s Automatic transcription and Subtitle editor to generate, edit and export VTT in one place.</p>\n\n<p>Our batch tool also supports <strong>srt to vtt</strong> for large projects.</p>\n\n<h2>what to do after you have your VTT files</h2>\n\n<p>Once you have a VTT file you can:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>upload it to YouTube, Vimeo or any HTML5 player</li>\n  <li>style captions with CSS classes</li>\n  <li>connect VTT output to your custom player via API</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i>This guide gave you clear steps to convert SRT files into VTT and integrate them into your publishing workflow</i></p>",
