    "content": "<h1>Convert SRT to VTT with HappyScribe tools</h1><h2>Understanding SRT and VTT formats</h2><h3>What is SRT?</h3><p>The SubRip subtitle format (SRT) is a plain text file that contains sequential subtitle entries. Each entry has an index, a timecode in HH:MM:SS,MS format, and the subtitle text. SRT is widely supported by video players, editing software such as Premiere, and online platforms.</p><h3>What is VTT?</h3><p>Web Video Text Tracks (VTT) uses the .vtt extension and supports features like styling, positioning, and metadata. VTT is required for HTML5 <track> elements and is compatible with streaming services and browser-based caption generators.</p><h2>Methods to convert srt to vtt</h2><p>You can convert srt to vtt using online tools, command-line utilities, or manual editing.</p><h3>Use the HappyScribe API for online conversion</h3><p>You can call the HappyScribe API endpoint to upload an SRT file and receive a VTT output. This free convert srt to vtt endpoint requires an API key. Example using curl:</p><ul><li><strong>curl -X POST</strong> -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" -F \"file=@subtitles.srt\" https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/convert/srt-to-vtt -o subtitles.vtt</li></ul><h3>Manual conversion using a text editor</h3><p>You can rename the file extension from .srt to .vtt and add the file header. Open in Notepad or any text editor and prepend \"WEBVTT\" on the first line, then save as .vtt. This method is free and works offline.</p><h3>Command-line conversion with FFMPEG</h3><p>Use ffmpeg in the terminal: <strong>ffmpeg -i subtitles.srt subtitles.vtt</strong>. This single command batch converts files and integrates with scripting. FFMPEG must be installed and in your PATH.</p><h3>Convert srt to vtt with a Python snippet</h3><p>Load the SRT file, replace commas in timecodes, add the header. Example Python script:</p><ul><li><strong>import re</strong></li><li>with open('subtitles.srt', 'r') as f: data = f.read()</li><li>vtt = 'WEBVTT\\n\\n' + re.sub(r'(\\d{2}),(\\d{3})', r'\\1.\\2', data)</li><li>with open('subtitles.vtt', 'w') as f: f.write(vtt)</li></ul><h2>Ensuring compliant VTT subtitle playback</h2><h3>Validate timing and format</h3><p>After conversion, use the Subtitle editor on HappyScribe or online validators to check timecode accuracy and styling tags. VTT requires dot notation in timecodes and optional cues for positions.</p><h3>Workflows for content creators and developers</h3><p>Video pros can integrate Automatic transcription with the Caption generator and batch export VTT files. Content creators can refine transcripts via Human-made subtitles, then run a single click conversion with the Subtitle editor or API.</p>",
    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What are the main differences between SRT and VTT?",
        "answer": "SRT uses comma separators in timecodes and has no header requirement. VTT requires a \"WEBVTT\" header, uses periods in timecodes, and supports styling cues, positioning, and metadata."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I batch convert SRT to VTT with FFMPEG?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can run a loop in your shell or script that invokes ffmpeg -i input.srt output.vtt for each file. This automates bulk conversion without manual steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a free way to convert SRT to VTT online?",
        "answer": "You can use HappyScribe’s free online convert srt to vtt endpoint without installing any software. You upload the file via the API or web interface and download the VTT result."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use the HappyScribe API to convert subtitles?",
        "answer": "Authenticate with your API key and POST your SRT file to the /convert/srt-to-vtt endpoint. The response returns a downloadable VTT file or a link you can fetch programmatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will manual conversion in Notepad preserve timecodes?",
        "answer": "Yes, provided you only rename the extension and add the header. After prepending \"WEBVTT\" on the first line and saving as .vtt, the original timecodes remain intact."
