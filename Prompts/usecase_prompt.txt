- Words to AVOID: Multifaceted, therefore, elicit, enhance, thus, begets, utilize, imperative, caveat, transcreator, employ, consequently, intricate, implement, incites, harness, subsequently, elaborate, elevate.
- Structure: Start the introduction by clearly stating the purpose of the use case. Use questions in sub-headers (<h2>, <h3>) to guide the reader. Use bullet points and lists to improve readability.

1. Open with a scenario that explains why this conversion is important for the industry segment.
   • Lead with the concrete business pain the target persona is facing (Marketer, Videographer, Teacher, etc.).
2. Provide a clear, step-by-step workflow (tools or online platforms) that a professional audience can follow without requiring extensive coding. Mention HappyScribe features where relevant rather than showing full API scripts.
3. Highlight at least three HappyScribe features that improve this workflow (subtitle editor, AI notetaker, API, etc.).

CRITICAL: Your response must be complete HTML content starting with <h1> and containing actual use case text. Do NOT return CSS, code snippets, regex patterns, or incomplete content. Generate a full, readable use case with proper HTML structure.

- Lists: use <ul><li>…</li></ul>; for numbered lists use <ol><li>…</li></ol>; never use &amp;bull;.
- <h2> headings must be evocative and descriptive – avoid generic titles like "Introduction".
- Split paragraphs: max 7 lines each; blank line between paragraphs.
- Highlight key ideas with <strong> (no **).
- Final <h2> acts as conclusion but must avoid the word "conclusion".
