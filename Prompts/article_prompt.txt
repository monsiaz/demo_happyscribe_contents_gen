Requirements
- Editorial Guidelines:
- Tone: Friendly, enthusiastic, and conversational, yet professional. Position HappyScribe as a thought leader. Speak directly to the reader (e.g., "you'll learn," "we'll dive into").
- Language: Use simple, direct US English. Avoid technical jargon where possible.
- Words to AVOID: Multifaceted, therefore, elicit, enhance, thus, begets, utilize, imperative, caveat, transcreator, employ, consequently, intricate, implement, incites, harness, subsequently, elaborate, elevate.
- Structure: Start the introduction by clearly stating the article's purpose. Use questions in sub-headers (<h2>, <h3>) to guide the reader. Use bullet points and lists to improve readability.

1. Begin with an engaging introduction that clearly states the article's purpose.
   • Start by framing the BUSINESS PROBLEM the reader faces before diving into technical definitions.
   • Adopt an angle for a specific persona – choose one that best fits the topic (e.g., Marketer, Videographer, Teacher) and speak to their daily challenges.
2. Provide at least four practical sections (use <h2>, <h3>) that focus on real-world scenarios, tips, and best practices for users (content creators, marketers, educators, accessibility leads). Avoid heavy code snippets; prefer plain-English walkthroughs, checklists, and actionable advice.
3. Intersperse best-practice tips and pitfalls to avoid. Include short illustrative examples only if they add value (no long code blocks).
4. Integrate HappyScribe product mentions naturally (Automatic transcription, Human-made subtitles, API, Subtitle editor, etc.). Include at least three internal links using <a href="#">placeholder</a>.
5. Headings must use Sentence case; acronyms like FFMPEG, SRT, VTT must be uppercase. No bland headings like "Conclusion".
6. Insert a **Key takeaways** block just before the FAQ:<br><h2>Key takeaways</h2><ul><li>…</li><li>…</li><li>…</li></ul>
7. Use basic HTML only (no markdown) and do not use the em dash (—).
8. At the end of the article, add a 'Frequently Asked Questions' section (<h2>) with 3-5 relevant questions, formatted as a Bootstrap 5 accordion.

Return STRICT valid HTML (no wrapper tags). 

CRITICAL: Your response must be complete HTML content starting with <h1> and containing actual article text. Do NOT return CSS, code snippets, regex patterns, or incomplete content. Generate a full, readable article with proper HTML structure. 

Additional formatting rules (strict):
- Headings: use <h2> tags only, Sentence case (capitalize first letter and proper nouns only). Do NOT use ALL CAPS.
- Forbidden: Markdown syntax, en/em dashes (–, —), placeholders.
- Lists: use <ul><li>…</li></ul>; never use HTML entity &amp;bull;. For ordered steps, use <ol><li>…</li></ol>.
- <h2> headings must be evocative and descriptive – avoid generic titles like "Introduction" or "Further reading".
- Split paragraphs: no paragraph longer than 7 lines; insert a blank line between paragraphs for readability.
- Use <strong> sparingly to emphasize key points (do not use **).
- The final <h2> serves as a conclusion but must NOT contain the word "conclusion"; craft an original forward-looking title instead.
- The last sentence of the article must be wrapped in <i>…</i> and provide a high-level summary.
