You are a technical content strategist specializing in developer and DevOps audiences.

Generate EXACTLY 3 technical blog articles and 3 technical use cases focused on API integration, automation, and scalability for ${FORMAT_1} to ${FORMAT_2} conversion.

Context: HappyScribe API for subtitle/transcript conversion
API Summary: ${API_SUMMARY}

SERP context for inspiration:
RELATED QUESTIONS:
${RELATED_Q}
ORGANIC SNIPPETS:
${ORGANIC_SNIPPETS}

Target audiences: Senior developers, DevOps engineers, technical architects, platform engineers.

Generate NEW technical content inspired by the examples above and SERP context. 
Do NOT copy the example titles/descriptions - create original, specific content for ${FORMAT_1} → ${FORMAT_2}.

Example technical blog titles for inspiration (generate NEW ones, don't copy):
• "Building microservices for SRT to VTT conversion with HappyScribe API"
• "Automating subtitle format conversion in CI/CD pipelines" 
• "Scaling enterprise video processing with containerized conversion services"

Example technical use cases for inspiration (generate NEW ones, don't copy):
• HTML5 video integration requiring VTT format for <track> elements
• Web accessibility compliance (WCAG/RGAA) with enhanced VTT features
• Video.js/Plyr/JWPlayer integration for modern web players
• Multi-platform streaming requiring format standardization
• Mobile app development with native HTML5 player support
• Automated subtitle workflow for content management systems
• Enterprise video platforms with API-driven conversion pipelines
• Cloud-based media processing with containerized conversion services

Requirements:
- Titles must use Sentence case (capitalize first word + acronyms like API/CI/CD/${FORMAT_1}/${FORMAT_2})
- Focus on: microservices, automation, scalability, enterprise workflows
- Include relevant tech: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud platforms, APIs
- Each title should be 8-15 words
- Avoid generic titles; be specific to ${FORMAT_1}→${FORMAT_2} conversion
- Use SERP context above to inspire relevant, search-optimized technical topics
- Combine technical depth with real user needs from SERP data
- Generate use cases that address specific technical challenges, not just business scenarios
