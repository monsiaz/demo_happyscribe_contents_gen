<h2>scenario: global event team struggles with inconsistent caption formats</h2>
<p>Your conference team just wrapped a weeklong series of presentations, panels, and keynote speeches. Speakers from five continents covered cutting-edge topics in AI, healthcare, education, and finance. You have hours of footage ready to share on your website, your Vimeo channel, and social media. But there is a hitch. Your caption files are all in SRT format. Your web platform and video player require VTT for native HTML5 caption support. Left unconverted, your captions either break on embed or fail accessibility checks altogether. That means potential attendees with hearing impairments, non-native English speakers, and SEO bots won’t see your content in the best light.</p>

<p>In a world where accessibility compliance is non-negotiable, event planners and content managers need a reliable solution to convert SRT to VTT quickly and accurately. Manually editing timecodes, frame rates, and file extensions invites errors and wastes valuable production time. The result is delayed publishing schedules, frustrated video editors, and risk of legal non-compliance with accessibility laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>

<p>Imagine a better way. A workflow that takes your existing SRT captions and, with a few simple steps, turns them into fully compliant VTT files. A system that automates the format shift, corrects timecodes if needed, and integrates seamlessly with your content management system. That’s where HappyScribe comes in. By leveraging our powerful API, intuitive subtitle editor, and AI notetaker, your conference recordings go live faster, with crystal-clear captions available in every browser.</p>

<h2>step-by-step workflow</h2>
<p>This workflow outlines how to convert your SRT files to VTT using a combination of local tools, scripts, and the HappyScribe API. Follow these steps to integrate a reliable conversion process into your event production pipeline.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepare your SRT files</strong><br>
    Before calling any API, gather all SRT caption files exported from your editing software. Ensure they match your video’s frame rate (23.976, 25, 29.97 FPS). Name them consistently, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>session1.srt</li>
      <li>keynote_morning.srt</li>
      <li>panel_discussion.srt</li>
    </ul>
    Store them in a dedicated folder, such as <code>conference_captions/</code>, to make scripting easier.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Install required tools</strong><br>
    You can run the conversion in any programming environment that supports HTTP requests. We recommend Node.js for quick setup or Python for familiarity. 
    <ul>
      <li>Node.js: <code>npm install axios fs</code></li>
      <li>Python: <code>pip install requests</code></li>
    </ul>
    You will also need your HappyScribe API key. Sign in to your HappyScribe dashboard, generate a new API token, and keep it handy.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Create the conversion script</strong><br>
    Below is a Node.js example. Save this as <code>convert_srt_to_vtt.js</code> in the root of your project.
    <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');
const axios = require('axios');

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_HAPPYSCRIBE_API_KEY';
const API_URL = 'https://api.happyscribe.com/v1/transcriptions/convert';

async function convertSrtToVtt(inputPath, outputPath) {
  const srtContent = fs.readFileSync(inputPath, 'utf-8');
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(API_URL, {
      input_format: 'srt',
      output_format: 'vtt',
      content: srtContent
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, response.data.vtt);
    console.log(`Converted ${inputPath} to ${outputPath}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Conversion failed:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
  }
}

// Convert all files in the folder
const files = fs.readdirSync('./conference_captions').filter(f => f.endsWith('.srt'));
files.forEach(file => {
  const input = `conference_captions/${file}`;
  const output = `conference_captions/${file.replace('.srt', '.vtt')}`;
  convertSrtToVtt(input, output);
});</code></pre>
    This script reads each SRT in the <code>conference_captions/</code> folder, sends it to HappyScribe’s conversion endpoint, and writes the resulting VTT file back to the same folder.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Verify the VTT files</strong><br>
    Open one of the generated <code>.vtt</code> files in a plain-text editor. You should see the WebVTT header followed by timecodes in the VTT format:
    <pre><code>WEBVTT

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Welcome to our international conference</code></pre>
    If you spot any misaligned timestamps, return to the HappyScribe subtitle editor to adjust timecodes or correct any typos. The editor allows frame-accurate adjustments and transcript corrections in real time.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Embed your video with VTT tracks</strong><br>
    Now that you have VTT files, add them to your HTML video element:
    <pre><code>&lt;video controls&gt;
  &lt;source src="session1.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
  &lt;track src="session1.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
    This ensures cross-browser compatibility and meets WCAG accessibility requirements. Repeat for each video file and corresponding VTT.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>key features that improve your workflow</h2>

<h3>1. intuitive subtitle editor</h3>
<p>Fine-tuning timestamps and text is a breeze with the HappyScribe subtitle editor. Instead of scrolling through raw code, you see a visual timeline paired with your video. Drag captions to adjust start and end times, fix spelling errors in-context, and preview changes instantly. Real-time collaboration means your editors, project managers, and accessibility testers can work together on the same transcript without version conflicts.</p>

<h3>2. ai notetaker for meeting highlights</h3>
<p>When your conference team debriefs after live sessions, the AI Notetaker feature automates minute-taking. Record Zoom or Teams meetings, let HappyScribe transcribe and generate bullet-point summaries, and quickly identify key decisions or action items. These notes can be exported to your project management tool or integrated via API to push highlights directly into Slack or Asana. No more manually scanning hours of discussion.</p>

<h3>3. powerful api for bulk conversion</h3>
<p>Our RESTful API handles large batches of files with ease. Convert thousands of SRTs to VTTs in a single call or iterate through your archive using the same script. The API supports multiple input and output formats including TXT, DOCX, SUB, and more. You can even request custom speaker labels, chapter marks, or inline styling directives. Secure your pipeline by managing API keys and permissions directly from the dashboard.</p>

<h3>4. automated quality checkpoints</h3>
<p>HappyScribe’s quality assurance system flags potential issues such as overlapping captions, extreme time gaps, or missing speaker names. Each file passes through an automated review before you download it. Get alerted to warnings in your dashboard or set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications in your collaboration hub. This prevents publishing a broken caption file that could derail your compliance effort.</p>

<h3>5. multilingual support for global reach</h3>
<p>Conferences often include presenters speaking multiple languages. With HappyScribe, you can translate your existing SRT into dozens of languages and convert translated captions into VTT. Our integrated translation API handles both transcript conversion and subtitle formatting in one seamless request. This expands your audience and boosts SEO by providing localized transcripts alongside each video.</p>

<h2>mini faq</h2>
<ul>

    <strong>Q: How do you handle different frame rates in SRT files?<br>
    A: HappyScribe automatically detects common frame rates from your SRT timecodes. If your captions use a non-standard frame rate, you can specify the correct value when uploading or include it as a parameter in the API request. This ensures your VTT timecodes match your video frames exactly.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Q: Are VTT files compatible with all major video players?<br>
    A: VTT is the official subtitle format for HTML5 video and is supported by all modern browsers and players, including YouTube, Vimeo, JW Player, and Flowplayer.
